After the huge response and viewership for my earlier article https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-restful-web-service-example I have decided to write a new article with all the REST calls example respectively GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
Let’s start this project step by step.
Prerequisites for this project:
If you have Eclipse, download the STS plug-in from here
If you don’t have Eclipse, download STS from here.
Download the latest JDK from here 
Also for testing please download and install SOAPUI tool from here 
The first example I am going to explain is about HTTP GET request, second example will be about HTTP POST request, third example about HTTP PUT request and fourth example is for HTTP DELETE request. In these entire examples I am going to use JSON Representation.
